     <h5>Climate Change</h5>
     <p>
     I believe that climate change is the most important issue we face today.
     I am in support of a tax on carbon emissions as well as a ban on fracking.
     In fact, I think we need to go even further on this issue.
     My goal is to pass legislation that will bring this country to 100 percent renewable energy by the year 2023.
    
     </p>

    
     <h5>Criminal Justice</h5>
     <p>
     I am in favor of decriminalizing drugs across the country.
     I do not think people should spend their lives in prison because of harmless substance use.
     Moreover, I want to release every non-violent drug offender right now.
     Additionally, we as a country should fight to ban private prisons.
     Lastly, I would like to require that body cameras be worn on police officers in areas of high rates of police brutality.
    
     </p>

    
     <h5>Foreign Affairs</h5>
     <p>
     I guarantee that I am the most anti-war candidate on the ballot.
     We need to end all wars and interventions we are currently entangled in.
     Likewise, I do not approve of dangerous weapons deals that in turn arm terrorists.
     No amount of oil is worth the endangerment of the citizens of this country.
    
     </p>
   
    
     <h5>Democracy</h5>
     <p>
     I want to pass an amendment on the behalf of the people to end money in politics forever.
     I support public funding of elections as well as a shortening of the election season to ensure all candidates have a fair chance.
     Lastly I would like to install an instant runoff voting system in this country to help independents and third party candidates in elections.
