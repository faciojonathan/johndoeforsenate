    Hi I am John Doe. I am 36 years old, and at this point in my life, I want to dedicate myself to public service.
    I was born and raised in Newton, Urgandale, where I was raised by two loving parents.
    During the early years of my life I participated in the Urgandale youth group and played soccer.
    In Newton High School, I was a member of the science club and was interested in chemistry.
    After high school I attended Ohio State University, where I studied biology and law.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I started my political career when I was twenty five and worked on the school board for Rapture county.
    I played a critical role in unionizing the school curriculum across Urgandale.
    After that, I served as a congressman in the third district.
    There I influenced healthy meals in school cafeterias and passed legislation to reduce food waste in grocery stores.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    I took a break from politics after the birth of my first child.
    I was dedicated to be there for my child in the early and most important years of their life.
    Now I wish to bring that dedication back to the community and serve the country as a senator.
    I think I can really make a difference in the world by giving it my all in the Senate.
    </p>
